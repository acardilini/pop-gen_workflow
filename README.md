pop-gen_workflow
====================

This repository will describe the step by step workflow I have used for my Population Genetics analysis. This will include a general guide for others to follow with their own data and more specific steps for my own data. 

This README file will guide through the pipeline and use of each of the scripts available and give a brief description about what they do. More indepth descriptions about each script can be read within each script itself.
